count
first purchase: comapiagn
->users additional purchases due to campaign
compaign: one day after initial
don't include uses make multiple purchases on the same day & make only the same purchases

1) self join table match userid
2) different date and product
3) count user id

select count(distinct m1.user_id)
from marketing_campaign m1 join marketing_campaign m2 on m1.user_id = m2.user_id
where m1.created_at != m2.created_at
    and m1.product_id != m2.product_id
    and datediff(m2.created_at, m1.created_at) >= 1;

wrong: didn't consider a user purchase 2 item in the same and purchase the same item the other days seperately
for exmaple
user_id	created_at	product_id
25	   2019-01-22	114
25	   2019-01-22	115
25	   2019-01-24	114
25	   2019-01-27	115


OTHER SOLUTION
with cte as (select user_id,
dense_rank() over(partition by user_id order by created_at) as rnk_c,
dense_rank() over(partition by user_id, product_id order by created_at) as rnk_p 
from marketing_campaign)

select count(distinct user_id) 
from cte
where rnk_c > 1 and rnk_p = 1;
